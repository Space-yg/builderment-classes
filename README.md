# Builderment Classes

Welcome to Builderment Classes! This is a JavaScript/TypeScript library that helps you create Builderment-related projects. This library is used in some of my projects such as [Builderment Seeds](https://space-yg.github.io/builderment-seeds/), [Builderment Builds](https://space-yg.github.io/builderment-builds/), and Builderment Bot for the [Builderment Discord server](https://discord.gg/builderment-618226575652945941).

If you use this library in any cool projects, be sure to let me know!
